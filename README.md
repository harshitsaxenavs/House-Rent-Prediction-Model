# House-Rent-Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts monthly house rent based on multiple property features such as city, area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, furnishing status, and tenant type. This model uses both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor algorithms to analyze data patterns and estimate rental prices accurately across different cities.
